# Blacklist International - Personal Project

This is my first personal project. I created this static website with HTML and CSS only to showcase what I learned from my HTML and CSS course. It is about my favorite eSports Team, Blacklist International. I was able to apply my knowledge on HTML and CSS, especially Flexbox, Grid and Media queries. You can view the website by clicking the link below.
